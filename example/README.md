# Example for the SÂ³I Flutter package

Basic app to demonstrate and test the functionality of the [S3I Flutter package](https://github.com/LukasPoque/s3i_flutter).

### Your Application

For the login in your own application you should use a client which is specific for your app. Please contact the 
[KWH4.0](https://www.kwh40.de/kontakt/) to get one. 
After that you can create your own `ClientIdentity("CLIENT_NAME", "CLIENT_SECRET")` with your specific data.
