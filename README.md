## About SÂ³I and KWH4.0

If you are not familiar with the SÂ³I concepts, please consider reading the 
[KWH4.0-Standpunkt](https://www.kwh40.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/KWH40-Standpunkt-S3I-v2.0.pdf).

For further information see the [KWH Glossar](https://www.kwh40.de/glossar/) and the other [Standpunkte](https://www.kwh40.de/veroffentlichungen/).

## Usage

For a basic example application see the [example](https://github.com/LukasPoque/s3i_flutter/tree/master/example).

### Setup Auth

Create a `ClientIdentity` used by your app. Please contact the [KWH4.0](https://www.kwh40.de/kontakt/) to get an app specific client.
```dart
final clientIdentity = ClientIdentity(<CLIENT-ID>, <CLIENT-SECRET>);
```

Now you can pass this to an `AuthenticationManager` of your choice. 
See [here](https://github.com/LukasPoque/s3i_flutter#auth) for a list of some implementations.
In this example we use the `OAuthProxyFlow`. You can specify some scopes to add specific claims in your token.
```dart
final authManager = OAuthProxyFlow(clientIdentity,
      openUrlCallback: (uri) {debugPrint("Please visit:" + uri.toString());}, 
      onAuthSuccess: () {debugPrint("Auth succeeded");},
      scopes: ["group", "offline_access"]);
```

Last but not least you should use this `AuthenticationManager`-Instance to create a `S3ICore`-Instance. Now you could work with the `S3I`.
```dart
final s3i = S3ICore(authManager);
```

If you want to assure that the user is authenticated before going on with other requests 
you could trigger the auth process explicit by calling the `login()` function:
````dart
try {
  await s3i.login();
} on S3IException catch (e) {
 debugPrint("Auth failed: " + e.toString());
}
````

### Send Requests to the directory

If the `S3ICore`-Instance is ready to use you can receive information about a specific thing by calling `getThing()`. 
If you don't need the whole thing it's recommended to use a `FieldQuery` so you only receive a part of the entry 
which is faster and safes network data.
```dart
try {
  var thing = await s3i.getThing(<THING_ID>, fields: FieldQuery(["attributes/ownedBy"]));
} on S3IException catch (e) {
  debugPrint("Request Thing failed: " + e.toString());
}
```


## Project Structure

TODO: s3i core / entry

### directory

### auth

The `auth` folder includes classes which are used to authenticate a user/client in the S3I.

The `S3ICore` needs a valid instance of a `AuthenticationManager` to work.
Currently there is only one implementation available: `OAuthProxyFlow`.
This implementation of the `AuthenticationManager` uses the S3I-OAuthProxy to obtain an access and refresh token.
But it doesn't refreshes the tokens automatically, only only if `getAccessToken` is called and the `accessToken` is expired.
